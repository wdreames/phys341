One measures the period, T, of the oscillations of the pendulum, which consists of mass, m, suspended from a cable of length, l. If the oscillations are small (less than a few degrees), then the period of oscillation is given by: \n",

    "Based on an extensive series of experiments carried out over many years, it has been found that the true mean survival rate (μ) for cats dropped from the Trible Library is 95%, with a standard deviation (σ) of 2%. Recent meetings of the CNU administration have resulted in a report that states that in any future experiments, the mean survival rate must be greater than 90.0%, but at the same time must not be greater than 98.0%. The rationale for these limits is unclear. It is suspected that representatives from the Faculty of Arts and Humanities were involved. You have been assigned the job of supervisor of cat dropping experiments at CNU. Your job depends on making sure these limits are not violated. As such, you need to write protocols for future experiments, and the most important thing to decide is: How many cats must be dropped in each experiment? Because your job depends on it, you decide to set the Type-I error probability, α, at 0.001. Calculate the minimum value of N that will be required for you to keep your job."
